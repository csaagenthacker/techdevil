# Hey, I’m techdevil 👋

I’m getting into Linux and using GitHub to document what I learn along the way.

This profile is a mix of notes, experiments, and small projects as I figure out how Linux and the command line actually work.

## What I’m learning
- Linux basics (filesystems, permissions, processes)
- Command line and shell usage
- Git and version control
- Breaking things and fixing them

## What you’ll find here
- Learning notes and references
- Small practice repos
- Configs and experiments
- Messy progress that gets better over time

I’m still early in the process, but I’m learning consistently and building habits.
